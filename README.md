# jenkins-dev-image
This Github repository is used to create a Docker image that can be used on development computers, to be able to run your own Jenkins.

This image has no integration with:

- Active Directory or any other IAM service
- E-mail services

The rest of the image is identical to the Kadaster Jenkins instances, which are derived from this development image.
